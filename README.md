### Creator, Server Owner, Future Plans 🔥

Hey, I'm **Nez**, the mind behind **Verdict**, a Discord marketplace that brings together top-tier services for gaming and community-driven projects. With a blend of self-taught skills and years of hands-on experience, I’ve not only run **three successful FiveM servers** but also worked with incredible developers to create some of the best bots and tools in the scene.

🚀 **About Me:**
- **Founder of Verdict (discord.gg/vdct)**: A community-driven marketplace where we offer everything from FiveM server management and custom bots to development tools and automation.
- **Owner of 2FAST:RP**: An immersive **100kOrDie FiveM server** set in **Australia & United States**, delivering high-energy roleplay experiences.
- - **Owner of 7SinsRP**: An immersive **100kOrDie FiveM server** set in **Australia**, delivering nostalgia from the past.
- **Experienced FiveM Server Owner**: I didn’t just manage servers—I **self-taught** my way through everything from server setup to custom scripting, creating immersive experiences for players along the way.
- **Collaborative Developer**: I work with high-tier developers to craft cutting-edge bots that make waves in the community. Whether it's creating Discord bots or pushing the limits of FiveM scripts, I’m always striving for something amazing.

🌏 **Melbourne, Australia**: While I’m based in Melbourne, I’m always working with talented individuals worldwide. The best projects come from collaboration, and I’m here to make that happen.
